## boopgrad 
A machine learning library built for educational and understanding purposes. GPU support to follow soon (Metal). Inspired by [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad)!

### roadmap
1. a fully working frontend that can train mnist using numpy.
2. a GPU backend (Metal first because that's what I mostly work on, and then Nvidia)

### docs / blog
1. I hope to write about this a lot during development and explain the core concepts. No guarantees though!

### developing
1. Create a virtual environment. `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. Install packages. `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
3. `pip install -e .` to install the package locally in editing mode.
