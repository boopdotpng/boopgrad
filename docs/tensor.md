## tensor.py

Tensor.py contains the major operations that can be performed on tensors, and a lot of static methods that generate new tensors of a certain format (zeros, ones, eye, etc). It also contains the code to run the backward pass starting at a scalar tensor (similar to the topological sort algorithm in [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)).
